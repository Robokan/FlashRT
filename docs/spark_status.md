# Spark port — current status

Snapshot of where the FlashRT-on-DGX-Spark work stands. Updated as
phases advance. The 7-phase plan lives at:
```
~/.cursor/plans/flashrt_jax_on_dgx_spark_f0288dd4.plan.md
```
Operational details: [`spark_runbook.md`](spark_runbook.md).
Durable agent rules: [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

## TL;DR

Code for all 7 phases is in place and committed to `spark-sm121-port`
on `Robokan/FlashRT`. The CMake configure step has been verified on
Spark — SM_121 / NVFP4 / FA2 flags all light up correctly. The actual
CUDA kernel compile has **not** been run yet. Phase 0–7 gates have
all been written but not executed against the hardware.

## Phase status

| Phase | Description | Code | Verified on Spark? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Build FlashRT for SM_121 + aarch64 | done — `docker/Dockerfile.spark`, `docker/compose.spark.yml`, `CMakeLists.txt` patches, `scripts/spark_build_smoke.py` | configure: yes; full build: **no** |
| 1 | `pi05_libero` Orbax load via `Pi05JaxFrontendRtx` | done — `scripts/spark_phase1_libero_smoke.py`, `scripts/spark_phase1_libero_run.sh` | no |
| 2 | LoRA Orbax load + fp32 merge (`pi05_openarm_ngc_lora_v4`) | done — `_maybe_merge_lora` in `flash_rt/frontends/jax/pi05_rtx.py`, `tests/test_lora_merge_jax_loader.py`, `scripts/spark_phase2_lora_load.py` | unit tests: not run on Spark |
| 3 | FP8 calibration on stratified OpenArm samples | done — `scripts/spark_phase3_prepare_calib.py`, `scripts/spark_phase3_run_calib.py` | no |
| 4 | Parity vs the openpi JAX server | done — `scripts/spark_phase4_parity.py` and `robot_action_dim` patches in `pi05_rtx.py` (torch + jax frontends and `flash_rt/api.py`) | no |
| 5 | Serve FlashRT via openpi WebsocketPolicyServer | done — `flash_rt/serving/openpi_adapter.py` (`FlashRTPolicyAdapter`), `scripts/serve_policy_flashrt.py`, `scripts/spark_phase5_adapter_smoke.py` | no |
| 6 | End-to-end robot success comparison | done — `scripts/spark_phase6_robot_compare.py` (append + compare CLI) | no |
| 7 | Latency breakdown for colocation decision | done — `scripts/spark_phase7_latency_breakdown.py` | no |

## What's definitely working on Spark

- `nvcc -gencode arch=compute_121a,code=sm_121a` compiles and runs.
- `cmake -B build -S . -DGPU_ARCH=121` configures cleanly. It prints:
  ```
  -- NVFP4/W4A8 support: ENABLED (sm_121a)
  -- Using gencode flag: -gencode=arch=compute_121a,code=sm_121a
  -- FA2 in-SO attention: ENABLED (sm_121)
  -- Motus beta kernels: ENABLED
  -- SM120a CUTLASS block-128 FP8: ENABLED
  -- SM120a CUTLASS NVFP4 W4A16 GEMM: ENABLED
  -- FA2 vendor arch: sm_80 + sm_120 + sm_121 AOT + compute_120 PTX fallback (Spark default)
  ```

## What's not yet verified

- The actual `cmake --build build` step. Compilation of the FA2 sweep,
  CUTLASS GEMMs, Motus kernels, and FA2 pybind module for SM_121. This
  is the biggest unknown — there *could* still be a code path that
  references `sm_120` in a way that doesn't generalize to `sm_121`.
- Every Python-side phase script (1–7).
- The flashrt_spark Docker image.

## Lessons learned the hard way

1. **`-j$(nproc)` crashed the workstation.** Spark's unified LPDDR pool
   means a heavy parallel nvcc compile competes with the desktop + IDE
   for the same memory. The OOM killer took down Cursor, not the build.
   Hard reboot required. Safe default is now `BUILD_J=4`. See
   `docker/Dockerfile.spark`'s comment block and `AGENTS.md` for the
   formula.

2. **Don't `tee` long compiles through the shell that Cursor mirrors.**
   nvcc + CUTLASS warnings flood the terminal mirror, can lock the UI.
   Use `nohup setsid ... > /tmp/log 2>&1 &` and poll the log file with
   bounded reads.

3. **`prlimit --as=8GB` looks safe but isn't.** nvcc/cicc memory-map
   large CUTLASS template specializations; tight `--as` caps trigger
   spurious "cannot allocate memory" failures even when resident usage
   is fine. The `-j` cap is the actual protection.

4. **Don't add FlashRT code to openpi.** The openpi-side scripts and
   adapter that originally lived in `Robokan/openpi` were migrated
   into FlashRT in commit `dc00926`. Robokan/openpi `main` is now
   rebase-clean against Physical-Intelligence/openpi upstream (just
   the user's prior non-FlashRT commits + a 2-line breadcrumb in
   `compose_ngc.yml`). Keep it that way.

## Next steps (when you're ready to run a real build)

```bash
# Option A (recommended): docker
cd ~/sparkpack/FlashRT
free -h                                                  # confirm ≥ 40 GB free
docker compose -f docker/compose.spark.yml build flashrt_spark
docker compose -f docker/compose.spark.yml run --rm flashrt_spark \
    python3 scripts/spark_build_smoke.py
```

```bash
# Option B: native uv venv (already configured in this checkout — the
# .venv with pybind11/ninja and CUTLASS clone are on disk).
cd ~/sparkpack/FlashRT && source .venv/bin/activate
nohup setsid cmake --build build -j4 > /tmp/flashrt_build.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > /tmp/flashrt_build.pid

# Poll without streaming:
tail -n 5 /tmp/flashrt_build.log
ls flash_rt/*.so 2>/dev/null      # success when these appear

# Then make flash_rt importable + smoke test:
uv pip install -e ".[torch,jax]"
python scripts/spark_build_smoke.py
```

Expected wall-time for the full kernel build at `-j4` on Spark:
~25–45 min. Worst case it hits a real `sm_121` codegen incompatibility
in some CUTLASS template; that's the bug the build is designed to
expose.
